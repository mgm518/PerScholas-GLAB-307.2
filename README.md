# Lesson 307.1 & 307.2 - Fundamentals of HTML/CSS

We are covering the basics of HTML and CSS.

For the assignment [PA-307.2.1](docs/PA%20-%20307.2.1%20Practice%20Assignment%20Wireframe.pdf), we were tasked with working on a 'wireframe' page demonstrating the layouts on the page.  For [PA-307.2.2](docs/PA%20-%20307.2.2%20-%20Practice%20Assignment%20-%20Create%20a%20Wireframe%20for%20your%20Login%20and%20Registration%20Page%20%20.pdf), the wireframe we worked on is for a login and register form.

I went a little crazy with the login portion and tried to implement an overlay login and register page.  It's not perfect, but it was kind of fun and challenging to get it to look proper ontop of the [index.html](web/index.html) page.
